<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Narayan Badatya, originally from the picturesque state of Odisha, India. With a strong passion for application development, 
	I've embarked on a journey that has taken me all the way to Japan, where I've been residing for the past four months. As an enthusiastic
	 application developer, I specialize in VBA, Shell script, and Batch script, skills that allow me to create efficient and streamlined solutions.
</p>

<p>My fascination with technology and my drive to learn have led me to explore the realms of AI, a field that never fails to captivate my curiosity.
	I believe in the power of simplicity when it comes to learning and problem-solving, always striving to find straightforward approaches to even 
	the most complex challenges.
</p>

<p>I'm also nurturing a dream of becoming a full stack web developer, which has ignited a fire within me to constantly expand my skill set and stay
	updated with the latest industry trends. Additionally, I'm excited about sharing my insights and ideas with the world, and that's why I'm working
	towards creating a YouTube channel. Through this platform, I hope to delve into thought-provoking social topics and offer insightful business case
	studies.
</p>
<p>Join me on my journey of exploration, learning, and growth as I navigate through the ever-evolving landscape of technology and creativity.
	Thank you for being a part of this adventure.
